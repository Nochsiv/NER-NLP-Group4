# NER-NLP-Group4




## Project Overview
NER-NLP-Group4 is a project focused on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Our goal is to identify and extract relevant NLP-related keywords from given text data, specifically targeting **academic texts** or **scientific articles**.

## Key Features
- Extracts key entities related to NLP from input text.
- Focused on processing academic texts to identify specific terms like techniques, models, or methodologies.
- Implements and evaluates NER using state-of-the-art tools and libraries.

## Dataset
The project uses **Abstract 10 Dataset** as the dataset. It contains a collection of academic texts, providing a rich source of NLP-related keywords for entity recognition.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Libraries: `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `sklearn`, `pandas`
