# NER-NLP-Group4

## Project Overview
NER-NLP-Group4 is a project focused on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## Key Features
- Extracts key entities related to NLP from input text.
- Focused on processing academic texts to identify specific terms like techniques, models, or methodologies.
- Implements and evaluates NER using state-of-the-art tools and libraries.

## Dataset
The project uses **Abstract 10 Dataset** as the dataset. It contains a collection of academic texts, providing a rich source of NLP-related keywords for entity recognition.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Libraries: `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `sklearn`, `pandas`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nochsiv/NER-NLP-Group4.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NER-NLP-Group4
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your text file(s) for analysis.
2. Run the NER script:
   ```bash
   python ner_analysis.py --input data/sample_text.txt --output results/output.json
   ```
3. View the results in the `results/` directory.
